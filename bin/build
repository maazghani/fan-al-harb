# Reports the configuration of Go and builds Offer.  This script also generates a sentinel file `binary-name.txt' which
# will contain the Git hash of the HEAD commit.  This sentinel is used by other scripts including `push' to
# apply versioning to the Offer artifacts.  Depends on `git` and `go`
#
# Usage:
#   bin/build
#
# !!! If ran for a linux machine:
#   Uncomment the lines that export the GOOS and GOARCH vars
#
# Environment variables:
#
#   GOPATH        Specifies the path used by Go.  If unset, will be set to the current working directory
#   SKIP_BUILD_EXTRAS   When set, don't build any extras -- API docs, tools, anything other than the Offer HTTP server
#
